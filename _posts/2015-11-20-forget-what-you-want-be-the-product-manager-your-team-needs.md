### Forget what you want. Be the Product Manager your team needs.
null

Company to company, you will find different definitions of Product Management. And if you're in a big company, organizations within will have a differing responsibilities for the role. But it's up to you, once you arrive within your product team, to be the Product Manager they need.

First thing first, identify your team needs and _align them to your strengths_, look to _delegate your weaknesses_. Understand how you can deliver the most bang for buck with your time and drive team goals forward.

### Strength

Focus your attention on the largest gaps of the team that align with your strengths. You won't always have a project manager, marketing manager, business analyst, data scientist, etc. This is your chance to step up and shine, to complement your core Product Management toolset and responsibilities. It will be immediately recognized and appreciated.

What happens when your product team has strength that matches yours? Double down through leadership and empower the team to deliver. Provide a base foundation with expectations of the work, check in lightly (course correct where needed), and let your team amaze you and your customers.

### Weakness

This is a great opportunity to network and most importantly, **learn**. Network, identify, and partner up with those who are willing and have bandwidth to help your team. You'll be amazed at how_willing_ people are. Sell the vision and the work (if you're a PM, you should be good at this) so others can easily understand the mutual benefits.

Once you start working together, take the time to learn the trade you're lacking. I've learned a great deal about copy from my time at AOL. I had mentors/partners and was exposed to copy that converts, editorial that engages, and headlines of the most trafficked websites in the world (Engadget, TechCrunch, AOL.com, HuffPo). It helped that [AOL **knows** Advertising][0]. I also thank [Mad Men][1] and Neville Medhora's book, [This book will teach you how to write better][2] (a cheap/quick/easy read). I've since contributed copy as a Product Manager for AOL, Zappos, Capital One and helped many others.

When partnering is not possible, learn by doing or see how you can get external resources while you sharpen and add to your toolset. As you expand the ways you can contribute, so do your options.

### Need + Want

If you can fill the needs of your team, word will spread, and you will be the Product Manager that teams _want_.
